full amount of such payment is not received by the Partnership within forty-five (45) days after the
delivery of such notice, as liquidated and agreed upon current damages for such default (it being
agreed that it would be difficult or impossible to fix the actual damages), the Partnership shall have

Partnership; and (2) any distributions that otherwise wonld be made to a Defaulting Partner during
such forty-five (45) day period shall be made to such Defaulting Partner at the end of such forty-five
(45) day period if, before the end of such period, the Defaulting Partner has paid to the Partnership
all amounts then due and payable.

hereof, the General Partner or its Affiliates, as the case may be, will not be allocated any portion of
the Management Fee so waived.
SECTION 10.4 Distributions in Kind. Whenever any Partnership property is to be distributed
in kind, such Partnership property will be deemed to have been sold for its fair market value (as
determined in accordance with Article Xll) immediately prior to such distribution and any Profit or
PI.IIL!. JOJ151.21 -33-Loss upon sUchhypothetical sale will be taken into account as contemplated by Section 10.1 or 10.2
immediately prior to such distribution.
SECTION 10.5 Regulatory Allocations. The following provisions are included in order to
comply with tax rules set forth in the Code and to permit the Partnership to obtain the benefits of a
"safe harbor" provided by Treasury Regulations ~ 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)( d). The allocations pursuant to
this Section 10.5 shall be made prior to the allocations set forth in Sections 10.1. 10.2 or 10.3.
(a) If any Partner receives an unexpected adjustment, allocation or distribution
described in Treasury Regulations I:i I.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6), there shall be allocated to such
Partner items of income and gain (consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of Partnership
income, including gross income, and gain for such fiscal period) in an amount and manner sufficient
to eliminate any Partner's Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, to the extent required by the Treasury
Regulations, as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 10.5(a) shall
be made only if and to the extent that any Partner would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit
after all allocations provided for in this Article X have been made tentatively as if this Section
JO.5(a) were not included in this Agreement. The foregoing sentence is intended to constitute a
"qualified income offset" provision as described in Treasury Regulations I:i 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)( d), and
shall be interpreted and applied in all respects in accordance with that section.
(b) The allocations set forth in Section 10.5(a) hereof (the "Regulatory
Allocations") are intended to comply with certain requirements of Treasury Regulations ~ 1.704-
1(b). Notwithstanding any other provisions ofthis Article X (other than the Regulatory Allocations),
the Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into account in allocating subsequent Profits, Losses and
items of income, gain, loss and deduction among the Partners so that, to the extent possible, the net
amount of such allocations of subsequent Profits, Losses and other items and the Regulatory
Allocations to each Partner shall be equal to the net amount that would have been allocated to each
such Partner pursuant to the provisions of this Article X if the Regulatory Allocations had not
occurred. For purposes of applying the foregoing sentence, allocations pursuant to this Section
JO.5(b) shall be made only to the extent the General Partner reasonably determines that such
allocations will otherwise be inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners.
SECTION 10.6 Adjustments to Reflect Changes in Interests.
(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respectto any fiscal period during which
any Partner's interest in the Partnership changes, whether by reason of the admission of a Partner,
the withdrawal of a Partner, a non-pro rata contribution of capital to the Partnership or any other
event described in Section 706(d)(1)ofthe Code and Treasury Regulations, allocations of Profit and
Loss shall be adjusted appropriately to take into account the varying interests of the Partners during
such period. The General Partner shall consult with the Patinership's accountants and other advisors
and shall select the method of making such adjustments, which method shall be used consistently
thereafter.
PHIL!.303151-21 -34-(b) If any Person is admitted to the Partnership (or the Subscription of any
existing Partner is increased) after the date of the Initial Closing in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement, the General Partner shall adjust the allocations otherwise provided for in this
Article X of Profit or Loss (and items of Partnership income, gain, loss and expense), for the fiscal
year in which such event occurs and for subsequent fiscal years if necessary, so that, after such
adjustments have been made, each Partner (including any Partners admitted after the date of the
Initial Closing and all Partners whose Subscriptions have been increased after the date of the Initial
Closing) shall have been allocated Partnership expenses, including Organizational Expenses and
Management Fees, equal in amount to the aggregate amount of such Partnership expenses such
Partner would have been allocated ifit had been admitted to the Partnership on the date of the Initial
Closing with a Subscription equal to that set forth in Schedule A after such schedule or exhibit has
been amended to reflect such Partner's admission or the increase in its Subscription; provided,
however, that (l) no item of income, gain or deductible loss realized (or deemed to have been
realized on a distribution in kind) before the admission of any new Partner shall be allocated to such
Partner and (2) allocations to any existing Partner of items of income, gain or deductible loss realized
(or deemed to have been realized on a distribution in kind) prior to the increase in the Subscription
of such Partner shall be limited to those permitted by Section 706 of the Code.
SECTION 10.7 Tax Allocations. For federal, state and local income tax purposes, Partnership
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit (or any item thereof) for each fiscal year shall be allocated to
and among the Partners in order to reflect the allocations made pursuant to the provisions of this
Article X for such fiscal year (other than allocations of items which are not deductible or are
excluded from taxable income), taking into account any variation between the adjusted tax basis and
book value of Partnership property in accordance with the principles of Section 704(c) of the Code.
SECTION 10.8 Timing of Allocations. Unless otherwise determined by the General Partner,
Profits and Losses shall be allocated at the time(s) it is recognized for federal income tax reporting
purposes.
SECTION 10.9 Authority of General Partner to Vary Allocations and Distributions to Preserve
and Protect Partners' Intent.
(a) Allocations and distributions in respect of the Shortfall Amount with respect
to Unrealized Investments are, in part, intended to ensure that the General Partner does not receive
distributions and allocations in respect of its Carried Interest if, after taking into account prior years
allocations and distributions, the Limited Partners would not have first received back their Capital
Contributions plus an eight percent (8%) return on such Capital Contributions ifthe Partnership were
to hypothetically liquidate on such date assuming the allocations and distributions are based on the
sale of the Portfolio Securities at their fair market values as determined under Article XII. If
allocations and distributions in respect of the Shortfall Amount with respect to Unrealized
Investments have been made in prior fiscal years and there is no Shortfall Amount with respect to
Unrealized Investments at the time a current allocation and distribution is to be made, allocations
and distributions may be made to the General Partner in a manner differently than otherwise
provided for in this Article X and Article XI so as to eliminate any economic distortion to the
PHILl-303151-21 -35-General Partner created by such prior years allocations and distributions. The General Partner is
authorized to act pursuant to this Section 10.9 only after first consulting with and being advised by
the Partnership's tax advisors that such allocations and distributions are the minimum necessary to
assure that the economic arrangement to the General Partner is preserved.
(b) The allocations pursuant to Section 10.1(a) for any fiscal year shall take into
account allocations pursuant to Section 10.1(a) for all prior fiscal years to account for circumstances
in which, for example and without limitation, Realized Investments in the current fiscal year were
Unrealized Investments inaprior fiscal year, to the extent necessary to avoid duplicative allocations
as the General Partner shall in good faith reasonably determine.
SECTION 10.10 Allocation of Operating Expenses Among Portfolio Securities.
(a) The allocation of Operating Expenses of the Partnership to each Portfolio
Security for purposes of determining (i) the Priority Payment, (ii) the Shortfall Amount and (iii) the
priority of distributions as set forth in Section 11.3, shall be determined in accordance with this
Section 10.10.
(b) Operating Expenses shall be allocated among the Portfolio Securities held by
the Partnership each time aPortfolio Security isdisposed ofby the Partnership. Such allocation shall
be made pro rata among the Portfolio Securities held by the Partnership as of the determination time
based on the relative fair market value (determined in accordance with Article XII) of each Portfolio
Security as of the time the determination is made, or on such other basis as the General Partner shall
determine in its reasonable discretion. The amount of Operating Expenses to be allocated as of the
time of each determination shall be the cumulative amount of such Operating Expenses incurred by
the Partnership, net of any income of the Partnership that is not attributable to a Portfolio Security
(such as temporary investment income) less net Operating Expenses that have been previously
allocated to POIifolio Securities pursuant to this Section 10.10.
SECTION 10.11 Adjustment of Profits and Losses with Respect to Excused Partners.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, there shall be appropriate adjustments to
the allocation ofProfits and Losses among the Partners to account for an Excused Partner's exclusion
from participation in any investment pursuant to Section 3.15.
ARTICLE XI. DISTRIBUTIONS
SECTION 11.1 Tax Distributions.
(a) Subject to Section Il.l(b), the Partnership shall distribute to each Partner
(including any tax-exempt Partners) in cash, with respect to each fiscal year, either during such year
or within ninety (90) days thereafter, an amount equal to the aggregate state and federal income tax
liability such Partner would have incurred as aresult of such Partner's ownership of an interest inthe
Partnership, calculated (i) as if such Partner were taxable at the maximum marginal income tax rates
provided for with respect to natural persons (or, ifhigher, with respect to taxable corporations) under
PHIL!.303151.21 -36-applicable federal and state income tax laws as determined from time to time by the General Partner
after consulting with accountants to the Partnership and (ii) as if allocations from the Partnership
were, for such year, the sole source of income and loss for such Partner (such distributions being
referred to herein as "Tax Distributions").
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (I) the aggregate aIllOW1tof Tax Distributions
that otherwise would be made pursuant to this Section 11.1may be reduced or not made with respect
to any fiscal year to the extent determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion, and (2) Tax
Distributions that otherwise would be made to aI1YPartner with respect to any fiscal year pursuant
to Section 11.1(a) shall be reduced by the amount of any other cash distributions made by the
Partnership to such Partner during such fiscal year or within ninety (90) days thereafter, provided,
however, that for purposes of this clause (2) any Tax Distribution made within ninety (90) days after
the beginning of any fiscal year with respect to a prior year shall not be accounted for as a Tax
Distribution for the fiscal year in which it was made.
SECTION 11.2 Timing of Distributions. The Partnership shall distribute the cash proceeds (a)
of all dispositions of Portfolio Securities and (b) all other current income (including, without
limitation, dividends or interest realized on the Partnership's investments), in each case net of
Partnership expenses and reserves for reasonably estimated future expenses and, subject to Section
3.1 I(a), follow-on investments in existing Portfolio Companies, as determined by the General
Partner in its sole discretion, as soon as practicable but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the
Partnership receives such proceeds or income, provided that, in order to reserve such proceeds for
follow-on investments, such follow-on investment shall be subject to awritten commitment executed
prior to the end of such sixty (60) day period. As a matter of administrative convenience, however,
the Partnership shall not be obligated to make any distributions until such time as the aggregate
amount otherwise distributable exceeds One Million Dollars ($ I,000,000). The General Partner may
cause the Partnership to make other distributions, in cash or in kind, in its sole discretion, subject
to the other provisions of this Article XI.
SECTION 11.3 Priority of Distributions.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.1 with respect to Tax
Distributions, prior to distributing any amount, the General Partner shall determine whether such
amount constitutes (i) a return of Capital Contributions represented by the cost ofthe investment in
the Portfolio Security disposed of or held in Money Market Investments or otherwise represents a
return of Capital Contributions or (ii) a distribution of income or gain from or in respect of an
investment in a Portfolio Security disposed of or held in Money Market Investments or in respect
of Bridge Financing. The cost of the investment in the Portfolio Security disposed of shall include
Operating Expenses of the Partnership that are allocated to such Portfolio Security in accordance
with Section 10.I0, to the extent such amounts have not been previously distributed to the Partners.
(b) All amounts to be distributed to the Partners that constitute areturn of Capital
Contributions as determined under Section 11.3(a)(i) shall be distributed Pro Rata to the Partners,

fiscal years;
(ii) Second, one hundred percent (100%) Pro Rata to the Partners until the
aggregate amount so distributed under this Section 11.3(c)(ii) in the current and all prior fiscal years

aggregate amount so distributed under this Section 11.3(c)(iv) for the current and all prior fiscal

prior fiscal years; and
(v) Thereafter, (x) eighty percent (80%) Pro Rata to thc Partners and (y)
twenty percent (20%) to the General Partner.

(e) The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, also may cause the
Partnership to distribute Portfolio Securities to the Partners (subject to Section 11.5). In the event
the General Partner elects to make such distributions in kind, the distributions shall be treated as a
distribution of the proceeds received from the deemed sale pursuant to Section J OA. Distributions
in kind to the General Partner in respect of its Carried Interest are subject to deposit into the Reserve
Account as set forth in Section 11.7. The General Partner may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
cause the Partnership to distribute to one or more Partners the proceeds from the sale of any Portfolio
Securities and to distribute in kind to one or more other Partners, including the General Partner,

distributed to the General Partner to the extent the General Partner has varied the allocations and
distributions pursuant to Section 10.9.
SECTION 11.4 Tax Withholding. If the Partnership incurs a tax withholding obligation with
respect to any Partner, any amount required to be withheld by the Partnership with respect to such
Partner shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as ifit had been transferred to such Partner
by the Partnership as an interest free advance. Amounts treated as advanced to any Partner pursuant
to this Section 11.4 shall be repaid by such Partner to the Partnership within thirty (30) days after
the Partnership delivers awritten request to such Partner for such repayment;provided, however, that
ifany such repayment is not made, the Partnership, at the discretion ofthe General Partner, shall (a)
offset such unpaid amounts against any Partnership distributions that otherwise would be made to
such Partner and/or (b) subtract from the Capital Account of such Partner, no later than the day prior
to the Partnership's first liquidating distribution, the amount of any such tax withholding not so
collected, in each case treating the amount so collected or subtracted as having been distributed to
such Partner at the time of such collection or subtraction. For purposes of this Section 11.4, any tax
withholding obligation incurred by the General Partner with respect to any Partner shall constitute
a Partnership obligation.
SECTION 11.5 Certain Distributions Prohibited. Anything in this Article XI to the contrary
notwithstanding, all Partnership distributions shall be subject to the following limitations.
(a) No distribution shall be made to any Partner if, and to the extent that, such
distribution would not be permitted under Section 17-607(a) of the Delaware Act.
(b) No distribution other than a Tax Distribution shall be made to any Partner to
the extent that such distribution, if made, would cause such Partner to have an Adjusted Capital
Account Deficit (or increase an existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of such Partner).
(c) The Partnership shall not distribute to any Partners prior to the dissolution and
liquidation of the Partnership securities which are not Freely Tradeable Securities without the
consent ofthe distributee Partner.
SECTION 11.6 Consent to Distributions. Each Partner, by becoming a Partner, consents to any
such distribution hereafter made or omitted to be made to the Partners or any of them in accordance
with this Article XI.
SECTION 11.7 Reserve Account. In order to secure payment for the performance of its
obligations under Section 14.7, the General Partner shall maintain, until such obligations have been
discharged, an account (the "Reserve Account") into which the General Partner shall deposit twenty
percent (20%) of the amount that is from time to time distributed to the General Partner in respect
of its Carried Interest (including Portfolio Securities distributed to the General Partner pursuant to
Section 11.3(e)). Cash funds deposited in the Reserve Account may be invested in Freely Tradeable
Securities or Money Market Investments, as the General Partner, in its sole discretion, deems
PHILl- 303151~21 -39-appropriate. The General Partner may, in its sole discretion, but is not obligated to, invest all or any
portion of such funds in Portfolio Companies to the same extent that Principals are permitted to
make such investments pursuant to Section 3.9. The net income or gain earned on amounts
deposited in the Reserve Account may, from time to time, be withdrawn by the General Partner. If,
as of the last day of any fiscal year. the aggregate value of the assets held in the Reserve Account is
less than the aggregate amount deposited or to have been deposited in such account, the General
Partner shall, within sixty (60) days after the end of such fiscal year, contribute into the Reserve
Account an amount sufficient to correct such deficit. The General Partner, in lieu of depositing into
the Reserve Account Portfolio Securities distributed to the General Partner pursuant to Section
11.3(e), may deposit an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such deposited Portfolio
Securities. Any funds remaining in the Reserve Account after the General Partner's obligations
pursuant to Section 14.7 have been fully satisfied shall be released to the General Partner.
SECTION 11.8 Additional Obligations. To the extent that the assets of the General Partner are
insufficient to satisfYits obligations to the Partnership pursuantto Section 14.7 hereof, the Principals

ofthe LLC and shall execute that certain Guaranty Agreement substantially in the form set forth on
Exhibit I attached hereto and made a part hereof.

any date (or in the event such date is a holiday or other day which is not a business day, as of the
immediately preceding business day) shall be determined as follows:
(a) a Publicly Traded Security shall be valued based on the average ofthe prices
on each of the five trading days preceding the day in question (which day in question, for purposes
of making any distribution of Securities in kind, shall mean the second business day immediately
preceding the date of such distribution), with the price on any day being its last sales price on such
day or, if no sale occurred on such day, at the last "bid" price for such Security, in either case, which
shall be quoted on the principal securities exchange on which such Security is traded or on the
Nasdaq National Market System (including the Supplemental List thereof); and
(b) all other Securities or other assets and liabilities of the Partnership shall be
valued on such date or day by the General Partner at fair market value in such manner as it may

under Section 12.1(a) as the General Partner deems necessary to reflect properly the restricted
marketability of such Security; provided, however, that the following Securities that are not subject
to a restriction commonly referred to as an "underwriting lockup" may be valued without such
discount:
(a) Securities which would be immediately saleable by the Partnership pursuant

"Rule 144") without any volume limitation applicable thereto;
(b) Securities which would, upon a distribution of such Securities to a Partner
